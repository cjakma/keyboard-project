# keyboard-project
Generic name for some keycaps to start, maybe a plate... then who knows!

This keyboard layout is designed with Linux / BSD / macOS / Windows in mind, as I use all of them daily for different things. It is based on a Razer Blackwidow for now, as I have two on hand. I would love to design a PCB as well, but it's currently not something I'm equipped to tackle.
