# keyboard-project
Generic name for some keycaps to start, maybe a plate... then who knows!

This keyboard layout is designed with Linux / BSD / macOS / Windows in mind, as I use all of them daily for different things. It is based on a Razer Blackwidow for now, as I have two on hand. I would love to design a PCB as well, but it's currently not something I'm equipped to tackle. 

The layout was created in Keyboard Layout Editor: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ Max Keyboards will be able to do a run of these for you. Once I've done the first order, you should also be able to re-order singles based on my order number. 

The plate was then created using http://builder.swillkb.com/, and can be purchased from http://lasergist.com/. Similar to the keycaps, it may be worth waiting until I've received a sample in order to confirm fit and finish before re-ordering, but the spacing seems to be pretty close...
